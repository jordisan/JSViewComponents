# JSViewComponents

JSViewComponents is an extension of standard [ASP.NET Core View components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
which allows to easily create **components with added JavaScript/TypeScript functionality for ASP.NET projects**.

**[LIVE DEMO](http://jsviewcomponents.jordisan.net)** {align=center}

### What this is:
- a way to extend the natural solution for ASP.NET MVC visual components (View components) with your custom components and additional JavaScript/TypeScript
- server rendered (no SEO problems; quick browser rendering)

### What this is not:
- not another heavy JS framework of browser-rendered library components
- not dependent on external libraries or polyfills

---

This solution includes two projects:

## JSViewComponents

JSViewComponents library; can be referenced as a Visual Studio project, or as a NuGet package.

## JSViewComponents.Demo

Example of a MVC project using (and extending) JSViewComponents.
